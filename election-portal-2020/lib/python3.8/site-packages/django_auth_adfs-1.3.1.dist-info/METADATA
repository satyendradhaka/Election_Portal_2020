A Django authentication backend for Microsoft ADFS and Azure AD

* Free software: BSD License
* Homepage: https://github.com/jobec/django-auth-adfs
* Documentation: http://django-auth-adfs.readthedocs.io/

Features
--------

* Integrates Django with Active Directory on Windows 2012 R2, 2016 or Azure AD in the cloud.
* Provides seamless single sign on (SSO) for your Django project on intranet environments.
* Auto creates users and adds them to Django groups based on info received from ADFS.
* Django Rest Framework (DRF) integration: Authenticate against your API with an ADFS access token.

Installation
------------

Python package::

    pip install django-auth-adfs

In your project's ``settings.py`` add these settings.

.. code-block:: python

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        ...
        'django_auth_adfs.backend.AdfsAuthCodeBackend',
        ...
    )

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        # Needed for the ADFS redirect URI to function
        'django_auth_adfs',
        ...

    # checkout the documentation for more settings
    AUTH_ADFS = {
        "SERVER": "adfs.yourcompany.com",
        "CLIENT_ID": "your-configured-client-id",
        "RELYING_PARTY_ID": "your-adfs-RPT-name",
        # Make sure to read the documentation about the AUDIENCE setting
        # when you configured the identifier as a URL!
        "AUDIENCE": "microsoft:identityserver:your-RelyingPartyTrust-identifier",
        "CA_BUNDLE": "/path/to/ca-bundle.pem",
        "CLAIM_MAPPING": {"first_name": "given_name",
                          "last_name": "family_name",
                          "email": "email"},
    }

    # Configure django to redirect users to the right URL for login
    LOGIN_URL = "django_auth_adfs:login"
    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "/"

    ########################
    # OPTIONAL SETTINGS
    ########################

    MIDDLEWARE = (
        ...
        # With this you can force a user to login without using
        # the LoginRequiredMixin on every view class
        #
        # You can specify URLs for which login is not enforced by
        # specifying them in the LOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS setting.
        'django_auth_adfs.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware',
    )

In your project's ``urls.py`` add these paths:

.. code-block:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path('oauth2/', include('django_auth_adfs.urls')),
    ]

This will add these paths to Django:

* ``/oauth2/login`` where users are redirected to, to initiate the login with ADFS.
* ``/oauth2/login_no_sso`` where users are redirected to, to initiate the login with ADFS but forcing a login screen.
* ``/oauth2/callback`` where ADFS redirects back to after login. So make sure you set the redirect URI on ADFS to this.
* ``/oauth2/logout`` which logs out the user from both Django and ADFS.

You can use them like this in your django templates:

.. code-block:: html

    <a href="{% url 'django_auth_adfs:logout' %}">Logout</a>
    <a href="{% url 'django_auth_adfs:login' %}">Login</a>
    <a href="{% url 'django_auth_adfs:login-no-sso' %}">Login (no SSO)</a>

Changelog
=========

`1.3.1`_ - 2019-11-06
---------------------

**Fixed**

* Fix retries towards ADFS in situations where ADFS didn't respond in time.

`1.3.0`_ - 2019-11-01
---------------------

.. note::

    From this release onwards, compatibility with python 2.7 and 3.4 is not guaranteed anymore.

**Removed**

* Python 2.7 and 3.4 tests
* Django Rest Framework 3.7 tests

**Changed**

* The URLs file to override the django rest framework login (``drf-urls.py``), was not a valid python module name.
  It was changed to ``drf_urls.py``. Th old name is still there but will be removed in a next release.

**Added**

* Added setting ``SETTINGS_CLASS``, defaulting to
  ``django_auth_adfs.config.Settings``. This provides a mechanism to load the
  ``AUTH_ADFS`` config from sources other than Django settings.
* Python 3.8 tests
* Django Rest Framework 3.10 tests

`1.2.0`_ - 2019-03-01
---------------------

**Removed**

* Django 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 support. They are end of extended support and keeping support for them was becoming too
  complex.

**Fixed**

* The django templates were missing in the wheel

`1.1.2`_ - 2018-12-11
---------------------

**Added**

* Added views to selectively disable SSO for login links

**Fixed**

* Existing users with an empty password raised an exception

`1.1.1`_ - 2018-12-07
---------------------

**Added**

* Add a setting to force a login screen and disable SSO on ADFS.
* Documentation about how to enable SSO for other browsers than IE & Edge.

**Fixed**

* Prevent username field from being overwritten by a claim mapping.
* Prevent traceback upon logout when ADFS config is not yet loaded.
* Fix fields in log messages being swapped.

**Security**

* Don't allow the audience claim to be ignored. Preventing access token reuse.
* Set an unusable password on newly created user instead of leaving it empty.

`1.0.0`_ - 2018-12-05
---------------------

**This version contains backwards incompatible changes. Make sure to read the entire release notes**

**Added**

* Windows 2016 (a.k.a. ADFS 4.0) Support
* AzureAD support (check the setting ``TENANT_ID``)
* Django Rest Framework support.
* Add a ``RETRIES`` and ``TIMEOUT`` setting for requests towards the ADFS server.
* Add the ``CLIENT_SECRET`` setting to support client secrets in the OAuth2 Flow.
* Users are now redirected back to the page that triggered the login instead of the main page.
* Groups a user belongs to can now be automatically created in Django (check the ``MIRROR_GROUPS`` setting)

**Changed**

* Django 2.1 support
* All settings that can be determined automatically are now set automatically
* When a claim mapped to a non-required field in the user model is missing,
  a warning is logged instead of an exception raised

**Incompatible changes**

* Because of the login and logout views that were added, the redirect URI back from ADFS should
  now point to ``/oauth2/callback``. Keeping it at ``/oauth2/login`` would have caused a potential redirect loop.

**Deprecated**

* these settings are now loaded from ADFS metadata automatically and have been deprecated:

    * ``AUTHORIZE_PATH``
    * ``LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL``
    * ``ISSUER``
    * ``REDIR_URI``
    * ``SIGNING_CERT``
    * ``TOKEN_PATH``


`0.2.1`_ - 2017-10-20
---------------------

* Django 2.0 support and tests.

`0.2.0`_ - 2017-09-14
---------------------

* Fixed a bug were authentication failed when the last ADFS signing key was not the one that signed the JWT token.
* Django 1.11 support and tests.
* Proper handling the absence of 'code' query parameter after ADFS redirect.
* Added ADFS configuration guide to docs.
* Allow boolean user model fields to be set based on claims.
* The ``namespace`` argument for ``include()`` is not needed anymore on Django >=1.9.
* Fixed some Django 2.0 deprecation warnings, improving future django support.

`0.1.2`_ - 2017-03-11
---------------------

* Support for django 1.10 new style middleware using the ``MIDDLEWARE`` setting.

`0.1.1`_ - 2016-12-13
---------------------

* Numerous typos fixed in code and documentation.
* Proper handling of class variables to allow inheriting from the class ``AdfsBackend``.

`0.1.0`_ - 2016-12-11
---------------------

  Allowing to automatically follow certificate updates when the ADFS settings for ``AutoCertificateRollover``
  is set to ``True`` (the default).
* Group assignment optimisation. Users are not removed and added to all groups anymore. Instead only the
  groups that need to be removed or added are handled.

**Backwards incompatible changes**

* The redundant ``ADFS_`` prefix was removed from the configuration variables.
* The ``REQUIRE_LOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS`` variable was renamed to ``LOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS``
